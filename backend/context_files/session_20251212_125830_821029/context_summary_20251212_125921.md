Summary:
1. **Primary Request and Intent**:
- Ensure a Contact for Jennifer Martinez (jennifer.m@globalmedia.com) exists in Salesforce and is linked to the Account named "Global Media".
- If a Contact with that email exists but the record page is inaccessible, follow the prescribed troubleshooting sequence (capture screenshots, try alternate access methods, check Recycle Bin, inspect list views, record errors, escalate to admin) and only create a new Contact after admin confirmation to avoid duplicates.
- Deliverables required: JSON payload (with action_taken set appropriately), contact_detail.png, account_contacts_list.png, and any error screenshots plus admin responses.

2. **Key Concepts**:
- Use exact email match (jennifer.m@globalmedia.com) as the primary deduplication key.
- Troubleshooting steps for inaccessible existing records: capture report/search screenshot with Contact ID, attempt Lightning URL, attempt Classic URL, search by Contact ID in global search, check Recycle Bin, inspect list views, capture all error messages/screenshots, escalate to Salesforce admin if still inaccessible.
- Do not create a new Contact while an existing (possibly inaccessible) Contact with the same email may exist; wait for admin confirmation before creating.
- Final artifacts must include a JSON object and specified screenshots.

3. **Errors and Fixes**:
- Observed inaccessible Contact record: a Lightning URL to Contact ID 003d3000004c8GnAAI returned an error page with messages: "We couldn't find the record you're trying to access. It may have been deleted by another user, or there may have been a system error. Ask your administrator for help." (Lightning URL seen: https://nosoftware-innovation-6210.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Contact/003d3000004c8GnAAI/view).
- Global search for "jennifer.m@globalmedia.com" returned no matches ("We searched the objects you use most and didn't find any matches for 'jennifer.m@globalmedia.com'").
- Account "Global Media" exists (Account record opened) and its Contacts related list shows 0 contacts.

4. **Problem Solving**:
- Opened Salesforce UI, navigated to Contacts, used the global search for the email (no contact results).
- Switched to Accounts, located and opened the Account "Global Media" (Account record viewed).
- From the Global Media Account record, opened the New Contact quick action.
- Populated the New Contact modal with First Name = "Jennifer" and Last Name = "Martinez"; Account is set to "Global Media" (pre-selected).
- Did not yet enter Email or Title, and did not save the New Contact (creation paused pending resolution of potential existing/inaccessible record).

5. **Pending Tasks**:
- Capture required screenshots:
  - report/search result showing any existing Contact (including Contact ID and visible fields) if found,
  - error page(s) showing Contact ID and error text,
  - contact_detail.png and account_contacts_list.png as specified.
- Attempt alternate record access for Contact ID 003d3000004c8GnAAI:
  - open via Lightning URL (observed Lightning URL returned "Page not found"),
  - attempt Classic URL format for the same Contact ID,
  - search by Contact ID in global search and open from results.
- Check Recycle Bin for Contact ID 003d3000004c8GnAAI and screenshot if present.
- Inspect Contacts list views that might include the Contact and attempt to open record from a list view; screenshot the row if present.
- Record exact error messages and capture screenshots for each accessibility attempt.
- If Contact remains inaccessible after these attempts, escalate to a Salesforce administrator including: Contact ID (003d3000004c8GnAAI), attempted Contact URL(s), Account ID (001d300000BOv6uAAD), screenshots, and a request to restore visibility or confirm deletion/soft-delete/sharing restrictions.
- Wait for admin confirmation before creating a new Contact. Only create the Contact after admin confirms deletion/inaccessibility or grants permission.

6. **Current Work**:
- New Contact modal is open on Account "Global Media" (Account ID 001d300000BOv6uAAD).
- Fields already entered: First Name = "Jennifer", Last Name = "Martinez", Account = "Global Media".
- Fields not yet entered / actions not yet taken: Email (jennifer.m@globalmedia.com) not entered, Title (Senior Marketing Manager) not entered, Save not clicked. Creation is on hold pending the troubleshooting/escalation workflow.

7. **Optional Next Step**:
- Escalate to Salesforce administrator if Contact ID 003d3000004c8GnAAI remains inaccessible. Suggested concise admin message (from task guidance) to include with screenshots and attempted URLs:
  - "Please investigate access for Contact ID 003d3000004c8GnAAI. Worker can see the record in a report but opening the record returns 'Page not found' / inaccessible. Please confirm whether the record is deleted, has restricted sharing, or needs record-level access for the worker user. If deleted, please restore or confirm deletion so we may create a new Contact. If sharing prevents access, please grant viewing/editing permission or advise next steps."
- After admin confirmation (deleted or access granted), complete the Contact creation by entering Email = "jennifer.m@globalmedia.com", Title = "Senior Marketing Manager", saving the Contact linked to Account "Global Media", and produce the required JSON and screenshots.

- **All User Messages**:
- You need to process one given task.  Please keep in mind the task you are going to process, the content of the task that you need to do is:  ============================== Objective: Ensure contact jennifer.m@globalmedia.com exists and is linked to Account 'Global Media'. If a Contact with this email is found but the record page is inaccessible, follow these steps before creating or modifying any records: 1) Capture evidence: take a screenshot of the report/search result that shows the Contact (include Contact ID and any visible fields). 2) Attempt alternate record access methods and capture screenshots for each: a) Open the Contact by direct Lightning URL (https://<your-domain>.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Contact/<ContactID>/view). b) Open the Contact by Classic URL format (https://<your-domain>.salesforce.com/<ContactID>). c) Search for the Contact by Contact ID in global search and open from results. d) Check the Recycle Bin (Deleted Records) for the Contact ID and screenshot if present. 3) Inspect list views: create or open a Contacts list view that includes the Contact and attempt to open the record from there; screenshot the list view row. 4) Record the exact error messages and capture error screenshots for each attempt. 5) If the Contact remains inaccessible, escalate to Salesforce administrator with a concise request including: Contact ID, Contact URL(s) attempted, Account ID (if known), screenshots, and request to either restore record visibility or confirm whether the Contact is deleted/soft-deleted or has restricted sharing. Provide the following suggested admin message: "Please investigate access for Contact ID <ContactID>. Worker can see the record in a report but opening the record returns 'Page not found' / inaccessible. Please confirm whether the record is deleted, has restricted sharing, or needs record-level access for the worker user. If deleted, please restore or confirm deletion so we may create a new Contact. If sharing prevents access, please grant viewing/editing permission or advise next steps." 6) Wait for admin confirmation. Only after admin confirms the Contact is deleted or inaccessible and gives permission to create a new Contact, proceed to create the Contact with the required fields and link to Account 'Global Media' (create the Account if it does not exist). 7) Deliverables after resolution: the specified JSON payload (with action_taken set to created_contact, updated_contact, or linked_existing_contact as appropriate), contact_detail.png, account_contacts_list.png, and any error screenshots taken during troubleshooting. Notes: Do NOT create a new Contact while the existing Contact may exist (email match) to avoid duplicates; include all screenshots and admin responses in the task notes. ==============================  Here is the content of the parent task for you to refer to: ============================== We have a new contact at Global Media - Jennifer Martinez (jennifer.m@globalmedia.com) is their new Senior Marketing Manager.

If a matching contact or account already exists, avoid creating duplicates and instead update/link as specified below.\n\nSteps to perform:\n1. Open Salesforce in the browser (the browser will open already logged in). Navigate to the Contacts tab or use the global search to find existing records.\n2. Search for an existing Contact with email exactly "jennifer.m@globalmedia.com". Also search by full name "Jennifer Martinez".\n   - If a Contact with that email exists:\n     a. Do NOT create a new Contact.\n     b. Update the existing Contact fields if missing or different: set Title = "Senior Marketing Manager" and Email = "jennifer.m@globalmedia.com".\n     c. Ensure the Contact is associated with an Account whose Name is exactly "Global Media". If the existing Contact is not linked to that Account, link it to "Global Media" (see step 4).\n     d. Record that you updated an existing contact.\n   - If no Contact with that email exists:\n     a. Proceed to create a new Contact with the fields:\n        - First Name: Jennifer\n        - Last Name: Martinez\n        - Email: jennifer.m@globalmedia.com\n        - Title: Senior Marketing Manager\n        - Account Name: Global Media (link when creating)\n     b. Save the new Contact and record that you created a new contact.\n3. Verify the Account "Global Media":\n   - Search for Account with Name exactly "Global Media".\n   - If the Account exists, use that Account for the Contact association.\n   - If the Account does NOT exist, create a new Account with:\n     - Account Name: Global Media\n     - Website (if requested by Salesforce UI): globalmedia.com (enter if field available)\n     - Save the new Account and use it to associate the Contact.\n4. Ensure the Contact is linked to the Account "Global Media":\n   - If linking requires editing the Contact record after creation/update, perform the edit and save.\n   - Confirm the Account\'s Contacts related list includes Jennifer Martinez.\n5. Duplicate checks and conflict resolution:\n   - If a different Contact exists with the same name but different email, do NOT overwrite that record. Use email match as primary deduplication key.\n   - If a Contact with the same email exists on a different Account and that association is incorrect, re-associate the Contact to the Account "Global Media" and document the change.\n6. Evidence & documentation to produce (deliverables):\n   - A single JSON object (plain text) with exactly these keys and values filled:\n     {\n       "first_name": "Jennifer",\n       "last_name": "Martinez",\n       "email": "jennifer.m@globalmedia.com",\n       "title": "Senior Marketing Manager",\n       "account_name": "Global Media",\n       "action_taken": "<one of: created_contact, updated_contact, linked_existing_contact>",\n       "contact_record_url": "<full Salesforce URL to the Contact record>",\n       "contact_id": "<Salesforce Contact ID>",\n       "account_record_url": "<full Salesforce URL to the Account record used>",\n       "duplicates_found": <true|false>,\n       "notes": "<short plain-text summary of any special actions or issues>"\n     }\n   - Two screenshots saved as image files:\n     1) Contact detail page screenshot showing name, title, email, and Account link.\n     2) Account detail page screenshot showing the Contacts related list that includes Jennifer Martinez.\n   - If no action was taken because of an unresolved error, include an error screenshot and a 1–2 sentence error_description in the "notes" field of the JSON.\n7. Acceptance criteria (task is done only if all are satisfied):\n   - The Salesforce contact for jennifer.m@globalmedia.com exists (created or confirmed existing).\n   - Title is set to "Senior Marketing Manager".\n   - The contact is associated with the Account named "Global Media" (Account created if it did not exist).\n   - The deliverable JSON is complete and accurate, and both screenshots are attached.\n   - Contact URL and Contact ID point to the final record that satisfies the above.\n8. Edge cases / constraints:\n   - Do not create duplicate Contact records with the same email.\n   - If Salesforce validation prevents creation or linking (required fields missing or permission error), capture the validation error message and include it in the "notes" field and provide the error screenshot.\n   - Use exact string matching for Account Name "Global Media" when linking.\n\nDeliverable format summary:\n- One plain-text JSON object as specified.\n- Two PNG screenshots: contact_detail.png and account_contacts_list.png (or similarly named).\n- If applicable, one error screenshot named error_screenshot.png and an explanatory "notes" entry.\n\nPerform all steps in the Salesforce web UI and return the JSON and screenshots as the final results.', 'response_content': '{"content":"{\\"first_name\\": \\"Jennifer\\", \\"last_', 'tool_calls': "[ToolCallingRecord(tool_name='browser_open', args=", 'total_tokens': 525493}], 'token_usage': {'total_tokens': 525493}} ==============================  You must return the result of the given task. Your response MUST be a valid JSON object containing two fields: 'content' (a string with your result) and 'failed' (a boolean indicating if processing failed).  Example valid response: {"content": "The calculation result is 4.", "failed": false}  Example response if failed: {"content": "I could not perform the calculation due to missing information.", "failed": true}  CRITICAL: Your entire response must be ONLY the JSON object.
