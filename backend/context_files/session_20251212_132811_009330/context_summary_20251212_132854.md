{"content":"Summary:\n1. **Primary Request and Intent**:\n- Add a new Contact for Jennifer Martinez with First Name \"Jennifer\", Last Name \"Martinez\", Email \"jennifer.m@globalmedia.com\", Title \"Senior Marketing Manager\", linked to the Account named exactly \"Global Media\" in Salesforce. Produce JSON result file, two PNG screenshots, and a 3-line confirmation text file in the specified working directory.\n\n2. **Key Concepts**:\n- Primary deduplication key: contact email jennifer.m@globalmedia.com.\n- Exact (case-insensitive) Account Name matching required for \"Global Media\"; do not link to similarly named accounts.\n- Deliverables are specific absolute file paths under /Users/douglas/eigent/123456/project_1765545785045-2803/task_1765545820555-152.\n\n3. **Errors and Fixes**:\n- An initial page snapshot included an \"Unable to load\" / \"Looks like there's a problem\" message (tab title: \"Unable to load | Salesforce\"). No permission errors or HTTP-status errors were encountered later in the flow.\n- No remediation actions were required or taken for permissions or access issues.\n\n4. **Problem Solving**:\n- Opened Salesforce web UI in browser (session opened successfully).\n- Navigated to Contacts list page: https://nosoftware-innovation-6210.lightning.force.com/lightning/o/Contact/list?filterName=Recent and searched the Contacts list for the email jennifer.m@globalmedia.com using the list search box.\n- Observed the Contacts list rows (recently viewed entries such as Marc Benioff, Carl Benioff, Howard Jones); no existing Contact matching the email jennifer.m@globalmedia.com was presented in those list rows.\n- Navigated to Accounts list page and opened the Account record for Global Media: https://nosoftware-innovation-6210.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/001d300000BOv6uAAD/view (Account record id: 001d300000BOv6uAAD). The Account detail shows \"Contacts (0)\", indicating no linked contacts for that Account in the UI snapshot.\n- Launched the New Contact quick action from the Global Media Account detail: https://nosoftware-innovation-6210.lightning.force.com/lightning/action/quick/Global.NewContact?objectApiName=Contact&context=RECORD_DETAIL&recordId=001d300000BOv6uAAD&backgroundContext=%2Flightning%2Fr%2FAccount%2F001d300000BOv6uAAD%2Fview\n- In the New Contact dialog, populated fields:\n  - First Name: Jennifer\n  - Last Name: Martinez\n  - Account Name: Global Media (preselected/current selection)\n  - Title: Senior Marketing Manager\n  - Email: jennifer.m@globalmedia.com\n- Did NOT perform the final Save action in the UI (no Save click executed in the recorded actions), so no Contact record was created and no Contact record ID/Contact detail page URL exist yet.\n\n5. **Pending Tasks**:\n- Click \"Save\" in the New Contact modal to create the Contact record.\n- After saving, open the newly created Contact detail page and capture the Contact detail screenshot to /Users/douglas/eigent/123456/project_1765545785045-2803/task_1765545820555-152/jennifer_martinez_contact.png.\n- Open the linked Account detail page (Global Media) and capture the Account screenshot to /Users/douglas/eigent/123456/project_1765545785045-2803/task_1765545820555-152/global_media_account.png.\n- Produce and save the JSON deliverable at /Users/douglas/eigent/123456/project_1765545785045-2803/task_1765545820555-152/jennifer_martinez_salesforce_result.json with accurate fields (action should be one of created_contact/updated_contact/found_existing_contact_no_change/failed, contact_record_id/contact_url null until save completes, account_record_id and account_url populated).\n- Produce the 3-line confirmation text file at /Users/douglas/eigent/123456/project_1765545785045-2803/task_1765545820555-152/jennifer_martinez_confirmation.txt with final state, Contact ID and URL, Account ID and URL.\n\n6. **Current Work**:\n- Browser opened and navigated to Contacts and Accounts pages.\n- Searched Contacts for email jennifer.m@globalmedia.com (no matching Contact shown in list rows captured).\n- Located and opened Account \"Global Media\" (record id: 001d300000BOv6uAAD; account URL: https://nosoftware-innovation-6210.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/001d300000BOv6uAAD/view).\n- Launched New Contact quick action and filled the New Contact form with the provided details (First Name Jennifer, Last Name Martinez, Title Senior Marketing Manager, Email jennifer.m@globalmedia.com). Account field is set to Global Media in the form.\n- No Contact record was created because Save was not clicked; therefore contact_record_id and contact_url are not available.\n\n7. **Optional Next Step**:\n- Click Save in the New Contact dialog to create the Contact. Capture the Contact detail page URL and 15/18-char Salesforce ID from the created record.\n- Take the two required screenshots and save them to the exact absolute paths specified.\n- Populate and save the required JSON result file and the 3-line confirmation text file to the specified working directory.\n- If any permission or save error occurs when clicking Save, capture a screenshot of the error page at /Users/douglas/eigent/123456/project_1765545785045-2803/task_1765545820555-152/salesforce_error.png and set the JSON action to \"failed\" with the error message.\n\nURLs visited/processed (from recorded actions):\n- Contacts list: https://nosoftware-innovation-6210.lightning.force.com/lightning/o/Contact/list?filterName=Recent\n- Global Media Account detail: https://nosoftware-innovation-6210.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/001d300000BOv6uAAD/view\n- New Contact quick action (modal): https://nosoftware-innovation-6210.lightning.force.com/lightning/action/quick/Global.NewContact?objectApiName=Contact&context=RECORD_DETAIL&recordId=001d300000BOv6uAAD&backgroundContext=%2Flightning%2Fr%2FAccount%2F001d300000BOv6uAAD%2Fview\n\nFinal status summary (action taken so far):\n- New Contact form prepared and populated for Jennifer Martinez and linked to existing Account Global Media (001d300000BOv6uAAD), but the Contact was NOT saved. Required deliverables (JSON file, two PNG screenshots, confirmation text) have not been created yet.\n","failed":true}
