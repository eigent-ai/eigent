{"content":"Summary:\n1. **Primary Request and Intent**:\n- Add or update a Salesforce Contact for email \"jennifer.m@globalmedia.com\" with: First Name = \"Jennifer\", Last Name = \"Martinez\", Email = \"jennifer.m@globalmedia.com\", Title = \"Senior Marketing Manager\", and link the Contact to the \"Global Media\" Account. Deliverable must state whether the Contact was \"created\" or \"updated\", and provide the Contact record URL and 18-character Contact record ID.\n\n2. **Key Concepts**:\n- Search Contacts by exact email and open the Contact record that exactly matches the email if present; otherwise create a new Contact.\n- Link the Contact to the \"Global Media\" Account (Account record URL and ID available from prerequisite task).\n- Known Account details from prerequisite: Account record URL: https://nosoftware-innovation-6210.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/001d300000BOv6uAAD/view\n- Known Account Salesforce 18-character ID: 001d300000BOv6uAAD\n- URLs visited during the session: \n  - Contacts list: https://nosoftware-innovation-6210.lightning.force.com/lightning/o/Contact/list?filterName=Recent\n  - Global search results (one.app): https://nosoftware-innovation-6210.lightning.force.com/one/one.app#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%3D%3D\n  - New Contact quick action (modal): https://nosoftware-innovation-6210.lightning.force.com/lightning/action/quick/Global.NewContact?objectApiName=Contact&context=RECORD_DETAIL&recordId=001d300000BOv6uAAD&backgroundContext=%2Flightning%2Fr%2FAccount%2F001d300000BOv6uAAD%2Fview\n\n3. **Errors and Fixes**:\n- A click action failed at one point: \"Action click failed: Error: Click failed: Element with ref e2139 not found\" (recorded by the browser tool). No further corrective action was taken for that specific failure, but the workflow proceeded via alternate interactions.\n- Search returned no Contact matches for the email (no contacts found). No duplicate/conflict error surfaced.\n\n4. **Problem Solving**:\n- Steps performed in the session:\n  - Opened Salesforce in the logged-in browser session.\n  - Opened Contacts list view: https://nosoftware-innovation-6210.lightning.force.com/lightning/o/Contact/list?filterName=Recent\n  - Entered and executed search for the email jennifer.m@globalmedia.com via the global search box; the top-results search returned no matches (\"didn't find any matches\" / \"Contacts 0\").\n  - Navigated to the \"Global Media\" Account page (Account URL above) which was already present.\n  - Opened the New Contact quick action from the Global Media Account; the New Contact modal opened with \"Account Name - Current Selection: Global Media\" preselected.\n- Findings: No existing Contact with the exact email jennifer.m@globalmedia.com was found during the search. The New Contact form is ready to create the Contact with the account pre-linked.\n\n5. **Pending Tasks**:\n- Create the new Contact (fill fields and Save) because search returned no matches; the create step was not completed in this session.\n- Deliverable items still outstanding: a) explicit statement whether the Contact was \"created\" or \"updated\"; b) the Contact record URL; c) the Salesforce 18-character Contact record ID. These cannot be provided until the Contact is saved.\n\n6. **Current Work**:\n- Actions completed (no destructive changes made):\n  - Confirmed no existing Contact matched jennifer.m@globalmedia.com.\n  - Opened the Global Media Account: https://nosoftware-innovation-6210.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/001d300000BOv6uAAD/view (ID 001d300000BOv6uAAD).\n  - Opened the New Contact dialog scoped to the Global Media Account (New Contact modal URL shown above). The New Contact modal displays fields for First Name, Last Name (required), Account Name (Current Selection: Global Media), Title, Email, and Phone, and shows Save/Cancel buttons.\n- No Contact record was created or updated during this session (Save was not clicked / no Contact record URL or ID was produced).\n\n7. **Optional Next Step**:\n- To complete the parent task, in the New Contact modal enter:\n  - First Name: Jennifer\n  - Last Name: Martinez\n  - Email: jennifer.m@globalmedia.com\n  - Title: Senior Marketing Manager\n  - Ensure Account Name remains linked to Global Media\n  - Click Save\n- After saving, capture and deliver:\n  - Whether the Contact was \"created\" (expected, since search returned no matches) or \"updated\" (if an exact match existed).\n  - The Contact record URL and the Salesforce 18-character Contact record ID.\n\nStatus summary conclusion:\n- The session searched for the Contact and found no existing record. The workflow reached the New Contact form with the Global Media Account preselected, but the Contact creation was not completed. The required deliverables (created/updated status, Contact URL, Contact 18-char ID) remain pending.","failed":true}
