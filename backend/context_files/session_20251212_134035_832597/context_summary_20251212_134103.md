Summary:
1. **Primary Request and Intent**:
- Add Jennifer Martinez (jennifer.m@globalmedia.com) as a Contact in Salesforce and ensure linkage to the Account "Global Media".
- Produce the specified deliverables (JSON object with contact/account details, screenshots of final Contact page and Account page if created, and a 2–4 bullet summary of actions).
- Follow exact field values and add an internal activity/note dated 2025-12-12.

2. **Key Concepts**:
- Performed actions in Salesforce Lightning (global search, Contacts list, New Contact modal).
- Required Contact fields: First Name, Last Name, Email, Title.
- Account-linking rules: exact "Global Media" match preferred; if multiples, prefer website/domain containing "globalmedia", otherwise choose most recent activity; create Account if none exists and set Website if quickly verifiable.
- Required activity/note: "Added/updated contact via assistant on 2025-12-12. Source: user-provided."
- URLs visited (from session snapshots):
  - https://nosoftware-innovation-6210.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Contact/003d3000004a2KMAAY/view
  - https://nosoftware-innovation-6210.lightning.force.com/one/one.app#... (search results for jennifer.m@globalmedia.com)
  - https://nosoftware-innovation-6210.lightning.force.com/lightning/o/Contact/new?count=1&nooverride=1&useRecordTypeCheck=1&navigationLocation=LIST_VIEW&uid=176554681967780246&backgroundContext=%2Flightning%2Fo%2FContact%2Flist%3FfilterName%3DRecent

3. **Errors and Fixes**:
- No system errors or permission errors were reported in the conversation logs.
- No duplicate-update blocking error was encountered or recorded.

4. **Problem Solving**:
- Searched global Salesforce for contact by email jennifer.m@globalmedia.com → search returned "no matches".
- Decision made to create a new Contact because no existing Contact with the email was found.
- Opened Contacts list and invoked New Contact modal.
- Populated fields in New Contact modal: First Name = "Jennifer", Last Name = "Martinez", Title = "Senior Marketing Manager".
- Focused/clicked the Email field (email textbox activated) but the conversation log does not show the email value entered into the Email textbox nor a Save action being executed.
- No Account search/linking steps were executed after opening the New Contact modal (Account Name combobox remained unpopulated in the recorded steps).

5. **Pending Tasks**:
- Enter Email = "jennifer.m@globalmedia.com" into the Contact Email field (not recorded as completed).
- Search Accounts for exact "Global Media" and either:
  - Link the Contact to an existing single matching Account, or
  - If multiple matches, open Account records to inspect Website fields and/or choose the one with most recent activity, or
  - If none exist, create new Account "Global Media" and set Website if verifiable.
- Add internal Activity/Note on the Contact: "Added contact via assistant on 2025-12-12. Source: user-provided." (or "Updated" if action becomes update).
- Set Contact Owner to currently logged-in Salesforce user (if ownership change is required).
- Save the Contact record and capture full-page screenshot of the saved Contact details page.
- Prepare required JSON object and additional screenshots (Account page if created).

6. **Current Work**:
- Salesforce Lightning was opened and a Contact details page (Marc Benioff) tab was active initially.
- Global search for jennifer.m@globalmedia.com was performed (no results).
- New Contact modal opened from Contacts list.
- New Contact form fields populated: First Name = Jennifer; Last Name = Martinez; Title = Senior Marketing Manager.
- Email field was clicked/focused but not shown as populated in logs.
- No Save/Save & New action recorded.

7. **Optional Next Step**:
- Continue the workflow: enter the email, complete Account search/linking per instructions, add the activity note, set owner if needed, save, take required screenshots, and produce the final JSON and short summary deliverables.

- **All User Messages**:
- You need to process one given task.  Please keep in mind the task you are going to process, the content of the task that you need to do is:  ============================== Add Jennifer Martinez as a Contact in Salesforce and ensure she is connected to the correct Account. Deliver exactly the requested outputs described below.  Steps to perform: 1. Open Salesforce in the browser (you may already be logged in). Navigate to the global Search bar. 2. Search for an existing Contact by email: jennifer.m@globalmedia.com.    - If a Contact with that email exists:      a. Open the existing Contact record.      b. Update the Contact fields to match these values if they are missing or different: First Name = "Jennifer", Last Name = "Martinez", Email = "jennifer.m@globalmedia.com", Title = "Senior Marketing Manager".      c. Proceed to step 3 to ensure Account linkage.      d. Mark the action taken as "updated".    - If no Contact with that email exists:      a. Create a new Contact with: First Name = "Jennifer", Last Name = "Martinez", Email = "jennifer.m@globalmedia.com", Title = "Senior Marketing Manager".      b. Proceed to step 3 to link the Account.      c. Mark the action taken as "created". 3. Ensure the Contact is linked to the correct Account named "Global Media":    - Search Accounts for an exact match for "Global Media".    - If a single Account named "Global Media" exists, link the Contact to that Account.    - If multiple Account records named "Global Media" exist, prefer an Account whose website or domain contains "globalmedia" (verify by opening the Account record's Website field). If still ambiguous, choose the Account with the most recent activity date. Document which Account you chose and why.    - If no Account named "Global Media" exists, create a new Account with Name = "Global Media". If you can verify the company website or domain quickly (one quick web search), set the Account Website to the company domain (e.g., globalmedia.com); otherwise leave Website blank.    - Document whether the Account was pre-existing or newly created. 4. Add an internal Activity/Note on the Contact record with the text: "Added/updated contact via assistant on 2025-12-12. Source: user-provided." (Use "Added" or "Updated" per the action). 5. Set Contact Owner to the currently logged-in Salesforce user (or leave default if ownership must remain unchanged). 6. Save all changes and confirm the Contact record is successfully saved.  Required deliverables (must be returned exactly as specified): - A single JSON object in plain text with these keys:   {     "action": "created" | "updated",     "contact": {       "Id": "<Salesforce Contact Id>",       "Name": "Jennifer Martinez",       "Email": "jennifer.m@globalmedia.com",       "Title": "Senior Marketing Manager",       "ContactURL": "<full Salesforce URL to the Contact record>",       "AccountId": "<linked Account Id or null>",       "AccountName": "<linked Account Name or null>"     },     "account": {       "Id": "<Account Id or null>",       "Name": "<Account Name or null>",       "AccountURL": "<full Salesforce URL to the Account or null>",       "created": true | false     },     "note": "Text of the activity/note added",     "timestamp": "2025-12-12T<HH:MM:SSZ>",     "errors": [ "<any error messages encountered>" ]  // empty array if none   } - A full-page screenshot image file of the final saved Contact details page (showing the contact name and linked Account). - If you created a new Account, also provide the Account record URL and a screenshot of the saved Account page. - A 2–4 bullet plain-text summary of the actions taken (created or updated, account linked or created, note added).  Failure handling: - If a duplicate contact with the same email exists but the system prevents updates, return the system error text in the JSON "errors" array and include a screenshot of the error. - If you cannot find or create the Account due to permissions, document the permission error in "errors" and still save the Contact (if possible) without the Account; include the Contact URL.  Notes: - Do not change other Contact fields (e.g., lead source, Do Not Contact) except to populate the ones specified above and to add the internal activity/note. - Use exact text values provided (name, email, title, account name). - Use the date 2025-12-12 for the activity/note and timestamp fields.  Return the JSON object, the required screenshots, and the short summary when finished. ==============================  Here is the content of the parent task for you to refer to: ============================== We have a new contact at Global Media - Jennifer Martinez (jennifer.m@globalmedia.com) is their new Senior Marketing Manager.
