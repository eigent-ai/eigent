Use browser console JavaScript to capture the table data if no export button is available. Save the extracted data as a CSV file.\n\nFinally, generate a statistical report based on the extracted data:\n1. Analyze ticket distribution by Priority level (Critical/High/Moderate/Low)\n2. Parse any dollar amounts mentioned in the Issue text (e.g., \"$50M\", \"$3.2M\") as estimated financial impact\n3. Create an HTML report with bar charts showing:\n   - Ticket count by Priority\n   - Estimated financial impact by Priority (parsed from Issue text)\nInclude a \"Data Notes\" section explaining that financial impact values were parsed from Issue description text since no dedicated financial field exists in the system.",
